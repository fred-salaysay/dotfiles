# Skill Guidelines

Write a PR description as per .github/pull_request_template.md.

Usage:
- Compare the difference between current branch and the main branch
- Read all the changes carefully. Skip the Description by AI section. 
- Wrap your output in a code block (````) using four backticks for safety, so I can copy it easier
- In the "What Changed" section, group changes into their logical domains. Use a 4th level heading for each group.
- In your output, have a separate section that is a commitlint compatible PR title
