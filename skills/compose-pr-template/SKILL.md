# Skill Guidelines

Write a PR description as per .github/pull_request_template.md.

Usage:

- Compare the difference between current branch and the main branch
- Read all the changes carefully. Skip the Description by AI section.
- Wrap your output in a code block (````) using four backticks for safety, so I can copy it easier
- In the "What Changed" section, group changes into their logical domains. Use a 4th level heading for each group. In this section, do not just enumerate the changes per file. Put more emphasis on the major changes that have been, paying close attention to architectural changes, feature improvements/additions, bug fixes.
- In your output, have a separate section that is a commitlint compatible PR title
